    "- [ ] Use a subset of the data where `BUILDING_CLASS_CATEGORY` == `'01 ONE FAMILY DWELLINGS'` and the sale price was more than 100 thousand and less than 2 million.\n",
    "- [ ] Do train/test split. Use data from January â€”Â March 2019 to train. Use data from April 2019 to test.\n",
    "- [ ] Do one-hot encoding of categorical features.\n",
    "- [ ] Do feature selection with `SelectKBest`.\n",
    "- [ ] Do [feature scaling](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html). Use the scaler's `fit_transform` method with the train set. Use the scaler's `transform` method with the test set.\n",
    "- [ ] Fit a ridge regression model with multiple features.\n",
